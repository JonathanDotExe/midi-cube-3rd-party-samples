# midi-cube-3rd-party-samples
A collection of sample sounds for midi-cube from third party sources.

The folders with the different sounds contain the sounds from different sources in sfz format with slight modifications to ensure compatibility with MidiCube!

The different licenses of the original sounds are in the README.md File of the sounds' folders. The original README.md files of the sounds were renamed to README_original.md or similar.
